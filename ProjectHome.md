When Raven Software released their SDK for Jedi Knight: Jedi Outcast resp. Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy they supplied a plugin for 3ds Max to export to XSI file format version 3 that is not compatible with newer versions of this software. Further more the latest built in XSI exporter is not capable of exporting to XSI file format version 3 which is required by the carcass compiler of the Jedi Knight SDK.

This exporter only relies on the MAXScript interpreter and thus should be compatible with all Max versions beginning from version 4.
